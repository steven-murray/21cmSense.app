# Sphinx-apidoc

From the "app" package directory:

```
% sphinx-apidoc -f -o ../Sphinx/source .
Creating file ../Sphinx/source/app.rst.
Creating file ../Sphinx/source/app.api.rst.
Creating file ../Sphinx/source/app.interactive.rst.

# Creating HTML files

From the _Sphinx_ directory:

`make html`


# Sphinx setup
Creating files:
Sphinx/source/conf.py.
Sphinx/source/index.rst.
Sphinx/Makefile.
Sphinx/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file Sphinx/source/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.
