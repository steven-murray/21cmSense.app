# SER401-Project43

**Summary**
	Project 43 is a web application targeted to the scientific and educational communities of radio astronomers and radio astronomer educators.  
The Project 43 sponsors wish to provide a more user-friendly interface to existing scientific code, 21cmSense - proven Python code that generates 
estimates of the sensitivity of different radio telescope configurations to signals coming from the very early Universe -  to broaden the potential 
audience for the software.  Project 43's web-based interface will run on commodity hosting platforms and/or ASU servers and will provide a pipeline 
with a user-friendly interface on the front end and API-driven integration with legacy code on the back end.
